Welcome to the ODISSEI portal.

The ODISSEI Portal combines metadata from a wide variety of social sciences research data repositories into a single interface, allowing for advanced semantic queries to support findability, and facilitate data access.

The Portal includes a link to the Data Access Broker (DAB) through which open datasets can be downloaded directly. For restricted access datasets, the DAB links to the provider’s page for more information. The link to the DAB is listed under Terms > Data Access Place for each dataset.

For more information on the main functionalities of the ODISSEI Portal, available metadata fields and their provenance for each Metadata Provider, see <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14524427">the ODISSEI Portal User Guide</a>.
