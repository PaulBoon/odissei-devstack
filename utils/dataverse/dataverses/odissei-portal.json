  "description": "Welcome to the prototype of the ODISSEI portal.\n<br>The ODISSEI Portal combines metadata from a wide variety of research data repositories into a single interface, allowing for advanced semantic queries to support findability, and facilitate data access.\n<br>The portal is under active development and features and content will be improved throughout the ODISSEI Roadmap project.\n<br>\n<br>This version features a link to the Data Access Broker (DAB) through which open datasets can be downloaded directly. For restricted access datasets, the DAB links to the providerâ€™s page for more information. The link to the DAB is listed under Terms > Data Access Place for each dataset.",
